# Variables
# A variable is simply a name to which a value can be assigned.

# Variables allow us to give meaningful names to data.

# The simplest way to assign a value to a variable is through the = operator.


# A big advantage of variables is that they allow us to store data so that we can use it later to perform operations
# in the code.

# Variables are mutable. Hence, the value of a variable can always be updated or replaced.

print(8 / 10)

var1 = 8
var2 = 10

print(var1 / var2)

# How to write exponential in python

print(4 ** 2)

print(18 % 7)

# lets say you start with 100 buck, at 10 percent interest how much is your net worth
# How much is your $100 worth after 7 years?
capital = 100
interest_rate = 10

net_worth = 100 * (1.1 ** 7)
print(net_worth)

# Naming Convention
# There are certain rules we have to follow when picking the name for a variable:

# The name can start with an upper or lower case alphabet.

# For example, you can define your income variable as Income or income, both are valid.

# All the names are case sensitive.

# For example, Income and income are two different variables and not one.

# A number can appear in the name, but not at the beginning.

# For example, 12income is not a valid name but income12 or in12come are valid.

# The _ character can appear anywhere in the name.

# For example, _income or income_ are valid names.

# Spaces are not allowed. Instead, we must use snake_case to make variable names readable.

# For example, monthly_income is a valid name.

# The name of the variable should be something meaningful that describes the value it holds, instead of being random
# characters. For example, inc or even income would not give any useful information but names like weekly_income,
# monthly_income, or annual_income explain the purpose of our defined variable


# ----------BUILT IN FUNCTION TYPE----------------#

# Example of different print features
savings = 100
growth_multiplier = 1.1

# Assign product of growth_multiplier and savings to year1
year1 = growth_multiplier * savings
year2 = growth_multiplier * year1

# print("my net asset in the end of year 1 is going to {}".format(year1))
year1 = int(year1)

print(f"my net asset in end of year 1 is {year1} and year2 is {year2}")

# Assign sum of desc and desc to double desc

var1 = 'interest'
# var2=var1*var1
# print(var2)

# Definitions
# The data type of item defines the type and range of values that item can have.

# The concept of data types can be found in the real world. 
# There are numbers, alphabets, characters, etc., that all have unique properties due to their classification.

# Such a classification is also made in many programming languages, including Python.

# Python’s Data Types
# Unlike many other languages, 
# Python does not place a strong emphasis on defining the data type of an object, which makes coding much simpler. 
# The language provides three main data types:

# Common Data types List but not all of them listed here

# 1) Numbers
# 2) Boolean
# 3) String
# 4) List
# 5) Tuple
# 6) Set
# 7) Dictionary
# 8) Dataframe

# so which of the following ways do are right for creating a list?
A = [1, 3, 4, 2]

# Slicing is the process of obtaining a portion (substring) of a string by using its indices.

# Given a string, we can use the following template to slice it and obtain a substring:

# string[start:end] 
# start is the index from where we want the substring to start.
# end is the index where we want our substring to end.
# The character at the end index in the string, will not be included in the substring obtained through this method.


# INDEXING AND LIST SUNSETTING
fam = ["sister", 1.7, "dad", 1.68, "mother", 1.13, "me", 1.89]

# ------------------DATA TYPE TUPLE AND ITS IMMUTABILITY ------------------------ #

# Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

# Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and 
# Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

# A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.

# Tuples are written with round brackets.
tuples = (2, 5.5, 6.6)

# Allow Duplicates
# Since tuples are indexed, they can have items with the same value:

# Example
# Tuples allow duplicate values:

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry")
print(thistuple)

# Tuple items can be of any data type:

# Example
# String, int and boolean data types:

tuple1 = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
tuple2 = (1, 5, 7, 9, 3)
tuple3 = (True, False, False)

# Complex Numbers

# Python also supports complex numbers, or numbers made up of a real and an imaginary part.

# Just like the print() statement is used to print values, complex() is used to create complex numbers.

# It requires two values. The first one will be the real part of the complex number, while the second value will be
# the imaginary part.

# Here’s the template for making a complex number:

# complex(real, imaginary)
print(complex(10, 20))  # Represents the complex number (10 + 20j)
print(complex(2.5, -18.2))  # Represents the complex number (2.5 - 18.2j)

complex_1 = complex(0, 2)
complex_2 = complex(2, 0)
print(complex_1)
print(complex_2)
